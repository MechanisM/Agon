Agon is a blogging platform that uses Redis as the method for soting data.

Why Redis?
---------
Redis is an extreamly fast database that runs from memory. Knowing this, I wanted
to make a blogging software that was lightweight, not only in it's code, but also
the software that it runs on.

Requirements
---------
I built this on Redis 2.0.4 and Redis 2.2.2, but it should work on all versions.
PHP 5.2+ is required (for Predis), but PHP 5.3 is recommended (Built on 5.3.6-8)
Any web server will work, I'll write the rewrite rules for Lighttpd, Apache2,
Cherokee

Install
---------
First, you need Redis installed. I will not tell you how do to that
    *cough*apt-get install redis-server*cough*
Upload the files to any directory to your server, and make sure config.php is
    writeable by the server and php
Navigate to the url, and you will be redirected to the install script
    Please note, right now, the install script does not work. Sorry :(
